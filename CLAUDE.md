# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Maintenance:** Update this file whenever architecture, commands, configuration, or key behaviour changes. This includes: adding/removing extensions or keywords, changing the cron schedule, modifying data storage format, updating notification settings, or fixing significant bugs. Keep it current — it is the single source of truth for this project.

## What this project does

Tracks Chrome Web Store keyword search positions for the **Accessibility Checker by WebToffee** extension and its competitors. Each daily run scrapes Chrome Web Store search results, records keyword positions and user counts, generates a tabbed HTML dashboard (`index.html`), and sends a Slack summary.

GitHub repo: https://github.com/Safwana-WY/chrome-extension-keyword-tracker
Dashboard (GitHub Pages): https://safwana-wy.github.io/chrome-extension-keyword-tracker/

## Extensions currently tracked

| Extension | ID | Competitors |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility Checker by WebToffee | `nidjdackonjofdcclfbdcapbkgghcdjf` | Siteimprove, IBM Equal Access, WAVE, Silktide |

Competitor IDs:
- Siteimprove: `djcglbmbegflehmbfleechkjhmedcopn`
- IBM Equal Access: `lkcagbfjnkomcinoddgooolagloogehp`
- WAVE: `jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh`
- Silktide: `mpobacholfblmnpnfbiomjkecoojakah`

## Commands

```bash
# Full run: fetch positions + users, update dashboard, send Slack alert
python3 tracker.py

# Regenerate dashboard from existing data without hitting CWS
python3 tracker.py --dry

# Install dependency
pip3 install requests
```

## Daily automation (launchd at 10am IST)

Managed by launchd (not cron). Unlike cron, launchd will run the missed job the next time the Mac wakes up if it was asleep at 10am.

Plist: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.webtoffee.chrome-tracker.plist`

```bash
# Check agent is loaded
launchctl list | grep webtoffee

# Reload after editing the plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.webtoffee.chrome-tracker.plist
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.webtoffee.chrome-tracker.plist

# Trigger a manual run immediately
launchctl start com.webtoffee.chrome-tracker
```

Check `data/tracker.log` to confirm runs are succeeding. A successful run ends with `main -> main`.

### SSH setup for git push (one-time)

launchd runs without a shell environment, so `git push` requires SSH auth to work without an agent. This has been configured:

- `~/.ssh/config` — sets `UseKeychain yes` and `AddKeysToAgent yes` for `github.com`
- SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) added to macOS Keychain via `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain`

If re-setting up on a new machine, run:

```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

And ensure `~/.ssh/config` contains:

```
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    UseKeychain yes
    AddKeysToAgent yes
```

## Architecture

**`tracker.py`** — single-file Python script with four responsibilities:
1. `run_check()` — scrapes CWS search pages for each keyword × extension ID, records 1-indexed positions; also calls `fetch_users()` per extension
2. `generate_dashboard()` — writes `index.html` as a self-contained tabbed static page (one tab per extension, no external dependencies). The "Last updated" timestamp in the header is shown in IST (UTC+5:30).
3. `send_slack()` — posts a Block Kit message covering all extensions: users, changes, competitor wins/losses. Logs a `[SLACK ERROR]` if the response is not `200 ok`.
4. `send_email()` — optional HTML email alert (disabled by default)

**How `check_position()` works:** Fetches `https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/{keyword}` with a browser User-Agent. Extracts all 32-character lowercase extension IDs from the HTML via regex (Chrome extension IDs are always exactly 32 `a-z` chars), deduplicates while preserving order, and returns the 1-based index of the target extension. Returns `None` if not in top `results_depth` (default 50).

**How `fetch_users()` works:** Fetches the CWS detail page and extracts user count, rating, and review count via regex. Stores as `_users`, `_rating`, `_reviews`. Current patterns: user count from `(\d[\d,]+)\+?\s+users`; rating from `aria-label="Average rating ([\d.]+) out of 5 stars."`; review count from `<p class="xJEoWe">(\d+) ratings?</p>`. If CWS changes their HTML, update these patterns in `fetch_users()`.

**`config.json`** — single source of truth for all extension definitions, keywords, and notification settings. Currently tracking 17 keywords × 5 extensions; each run takes ~3 minutes (2s delay per request). Slack posts to `#chrome-extension-keyword-tracking`.

**Data flow:**
- Positions stored in `data/positions.json`: `{ "YYYY-MM-DD": { "ext-id": { "keyword": position, "_users": N, "_rating": F, "_reviews": N } } }`
- Keys starting with `_` are internal metadata; `keyword_positions()` helper strips them when processing rankings
- `index.html` committed to `main` and served via GitHub Pages
- Changes detected by comparing today vs yesterday per extension
- Week-on-week comparison shown on stat cards and keyword table; requires 7 days of data

## Dashboard sections

The dashboard (`index.html`) is a self-contained static page with no external JS dependencies. Each tab covers one tracked extension and contains exactly these sections, in order:

0. **Product page link** — "↗ View on Chrome Web Store" link at the top of each tab, opening `https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/{ext_id}` in a new tab.

1. **Stats row (4 cards)**
   - Active Installations — user count with day-on-day delta
   - Reviews — review count + average star rating; clicking links to the CWS reviews page
   - Keywords in Top 10 — count with WoW delta; clicking expands an inline panel listing each keyword, its current position, and its WoW change
   - Keywords #11–20 — same behaviour as Top 10 card

2. **Week-on-Week Changes box** — two-column highlighted panel: left = improved keywords (with `#old → #new`), right = declined keywords. Requires 7 days of history; shows a placeholder message otherwise.

3. **Keyword Position History table** — one row per tracked keyword, columns: Current position + last 7 daily snapshots. Positions ≤ 10 are green, ≤ 30 are blue.

4. **Competitor Keyword Positions table** — one row per tracked keyword; each competitor gets two columns (current position + WoW change arrow). Requires `last_week_date` to exist for WoW data.

**Secrets handling:**
- `secrets.json` (gitignored) holds `slack_webhook_url` and optionally `email_password`
- `load_config()` merges secrets at runtime — `config.json` has no credentials and is safe to commit

## Adding a new extension

Add an entry to the `extensions` array in `config.json`. No code changes required:

```json
{
  "id": "32-char-extension-id-here",
  "name": "Display Name",
  "competitors": [
    { "id": "32-char-competitor-id", "name": "Competitor Name" }
  ],
  "keywords": ["keyword one", "keyword two"]
}
```

## Keeping the dashboard in sync

After any change to `config.json` (keywords, extensions, competitors), regenerate and push the dashboard immediately so GitHub Pages reflects the latest config:

```bash
python3 tracker.py --dry
git add index.html && git commit -m "Regenerate dashboard" && git push
```

## Git workflow

After any code or config changes, push to GitHub immediately:

```bash
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "Short description"
git push
```
